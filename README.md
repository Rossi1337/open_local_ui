## What is OpenLocalUI

OpenLocalUI is a Flutter-based desktop application designed for Windows and macOS users. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for running LLMs (Large Language Models) locally without the need for complex setups like WSL or Docker containers. Taking inspiration from OpenWebUI, which offers similar functionality in a browser-based environment, OpenLocalUI brings the convenience of a native desktop app.

## Features

1. **Native Desktop Experience**: OpenLocalUI is designed specifically for Windows and macOS platforms, ensuring seamless integration with your operating system.

2. **LLM Execution**: Run OLLAMA (Open Language Learning and Modeling Architecture) based models directly from your desktop, eliminating the need for external dependencies like WSL or Docker containers.

3. **MIT License**: OpenLocalUI is licensed under the permissive MIT License, encouraging contributions from the community and fostering an open-source development environment.

## Roadmap

Despite its simplicity, OpenLocalUI has enormous potential for growth and enhancement. Based on the LangChain Dart API, future updates will focus on adding more features and improving usability. Planned features include:

1. **Model Customization**: Enhance the ability to customize LLM models according to specific needs.
2. **Image and File Embedding**: Enable embedding images and files directly into the application for more versatile usage.
3. **Improved User Interface**: Enhance the user experience with a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Installation

OpenLocalUI requires only the OLLAMA client to be installed and running on your system. Check out the latest release and download the appropriate version based on your platform.
